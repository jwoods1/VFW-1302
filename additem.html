<!--Using the Project 1 Screen Example (add item page) as your visual guide and outline, use the HTML tags you have learned so far to apply semantic and meaninful markup to the add item page of our app. Remember you can't use the same content used in the example. Our example is for a grociery list so your's must be different. Yes you can still have a name field. Some of your form fields will be the same or similar but you should have some variations based on the topic you chose. That means you might have more form fields than what is shown in the example. Create a form that collects data which would make sense for the topic you selected.
HTML Markup Requirements
In your project you must use at least use the following tags at least once. You may add additional tags or form fields:
Correct Doctype tag
html, head, 5 meta tags (charset, keyword, description, robots, viewport), title, body
h1
form
input fields (include at least one of each type of: text, range, checkbox or radio, date, submit, hidden)
Note that range type does not work in the mobile Safari browser (iOS Simulator). This is OK. The solution to correct this is to use JQuery Mobile, but you won't learn or use this until the MiU course so for now don't worry about it.
textarea
fieldset & legend
select and option
label (with for attribute and matching input id on form elements)
a (clear stored data link AND display data link with href attribute set to #, which for now will just reload the page)
Note: Avoid using input type of file. The storage solution we are working with this month can not store files.
Remember:
Be consistent in your code! Check the rubric before turning in your assignment to make sure you won't miss any points.
Add HTML comments. At minium include the project name, your name, & your term number at the top of your document (after the doctype!).
All projects must be at least 50% completed to receive a grade.
