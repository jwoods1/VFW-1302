<!--Every app needs to have a launch page that displays when our users first visit our app. This gives our app some branding and, for more complex apps, allows our app to load behind the scenes without leaving the user waiting for something to happen. Let's make a quick launch page using simple HTML5 tags we've learned so far.
Create a new HTML5 document and call it index.html
This page needs to include:
A Header: Your App Name
A Description: A very short sentence or paragraph (or tag line) that describes the app
A Call To Action: A prominent "ADD AN ITEM" button. You can say "ADD A DUNGEON", or "ADD A WORKOUT", or something to that effect if your items will all be of a certain thing. This can be a text link OR if you want to get creative you can create a nice image.
Link your "ADD AN ITEM" to your additem.html page. Make sure it links correctly!
Use what tags are appropriate for the content and structure of your page. Don't forget, like all HTML pages, you need to include doctype, html, head, meta, title, body tags.-->
